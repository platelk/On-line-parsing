\subsection{\date{Saturday, March 21, 2015}}
Today, i start my logbook and setup my work environment. I have decide to use Latex for my logbook, my bibliography and my dissertation.\\
i have to write my slide for the 5 minute presentation of \date{Thursday, March 26, 2015}. \\
To do it well i have to make more research on my subject, but i don't find that much close related article about my subject, no one think about it or it's a dead-end ?
\subsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Find interesting article / book about my subject
\item write the plan of my presentation
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Done}
i have found 3-4 use full resources, but not directly about my subject. Some are about parsing, others are more specific about parsing in compilation but nothing about speed up syntax analysis in dynamic context (writing on your keyboard)\\
i have finish my plan for my presentation, i need made it now

\subsection{\date{Sunday, March 22, 2015}}
Today i need to make the slide for the presentation, i have plan 10 slide, i think it will be not to much but enough.

\item Practice my presentation
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Done}
I have done 14 slide, it's a lot but i don't know how to reduce. after a first try I'm very close to the 5minutes, but i need to practice more for being sure to be below.

\subsection{\date{Monday, March 23, 2015}}
I have to do more research, i will use the university network to access to some paper i can't access in my home.
\subsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Search more on incremental parsing
\item Prepare my presentation
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item I found some more interesting paper

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\date{Thursday, March 26, 2015}}

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item Little correction on the formatting
\item I saw me tutor quickly, he told me that we will good to produce a introduction and background section
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\date{Monday, April 13, 2015}}
After the dead line, i try to find more resources about my specific research because i think i didn't find the correct term.
In a second time i start to read 'Parsing techniques : a practical guide', that will give me the terminology and the key to better understand the paper i read.
\subsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finding more resources
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item I found interesting thing on 'dynamic parsing' and 'incremental parsing'
\item My read on the book just begin but the definition and explanation of what is a grammar is very interesting
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\date{Wednesday, April 22, 2015}}
I continue to read my book, but i finish the chapter on the grammar type
\subsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the limitation of each grammar
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item I found that my research will focus on type 2 grammar or 'Context Free' grammar, which are easier to parse because each production rules contain only ONE non-terminal rules that produce terminal or non-terminal sequence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\date{Monday, April 27, 2015}}
The finals are in 2 weeks, so i will put in pause the project until i pass my exams

\subsubsection{Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item I wrote my introduction, it's a little too short i think, and some English mistake are still in there so i need to go back on it, and my background section is just started, i really need to look more on other paper to see what to put in it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\date{Saturday, May 30, 2015}}
To change a little, i will try to start a parser from scratch with the Dart programming language
\subsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write a scanner and a lexer in Dart
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item I have a beginning of something, the most difficult part was to put the architecture to be sure it will be able to implement the 2 algorithm easily (mine and the most use algorithm for on-line parsing) but i think to have a good base.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\date{Wednesday, June 17, 2015}}
\subsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
