The research in on-line parsing can be done on several aspects. During my research I have look at how take the good parts of bottom-up and top-down parsers to improve the speed of the parser but still have some prediction through the top-down algorithm.\\
Other fields of study could be the prediction accuracy, the syntax modification and insertion optimisation, prediction algorithm to predict common errors made by the user and so influence the choice of the top-down algorithm and get a more accurate prediction.\\
The area is still open and the popularity and new discoveries made in genetic algorithm could be a way to improve the tools by making them more aware of the user particularity.
